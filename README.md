# Hello and Welcome!
**Hello, my name is Brandon and I am new to web design. I've been studying a course from Udemy on web developement for about a month now.**
**My methods may not be the best as far as layout choice, postioning, etc but I am open to feedback on my design. The following is my solution**

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

**I approached this challenge desktop view first and went back and adjusted CSS for mobile second. I did this primarily because of my**
**lack of experience with HTML and CSS. I think my next challenge I will design the site with mobile in mind first.**

## My process

**I first applied as many CSS properties as I could with the template information and created divs.**
**I used colored backgrounds to visualize where my divs and items were being positioned.**
**I then tweeked the width and positions and flex properties mostly through trial and error until I**
**got the desired effect.**

### Built with

- Visual Studio Code
- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Chrome Developer Tools
- Mobile-second workflow

### What I learned

**It is MUCH easier laying out and moving around things when they are in divs with class**
**names. I found it very useful using background colors on my divs to better visualize what**
**is going on when I change properties with flex, position, sizing, etc.**

### Continued development

**Hopefully just get more comfortable with flexbox and grid, pick up some bootstrap and javascript, etc. Just keep practicing!!**


### Useful resources

- [codepen.io](https://codepen.io/pen/) - **One of the most useful sites I know. You can just jump in and sling some code up to experiment real quick and easily visualize the results**
- [Flexbox Froggy](http://flexboxfroggy.com/) - **Fantastic way to learn flexbox with an interactive game!!**
- [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) - **Was very useful when it came to filling this thing out lol**
